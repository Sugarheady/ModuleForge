    // Module Forge's OWN log file: BepInEx\ModuleForge.log.
    //
    // His ask, 2026-09-25: a separate log per mod, so LogOutput.log is not
    // buried under ours when other mods are installed - "it's not a pain to
    // troubleshoot for other people." Our three mods wrote ~450 of the 486
    // lines in his last LogOutput.log; this one ~55.
    //
    // ★ A DELIBERATE COPY OF WEAPON FORGE'S `ForgeLog`, per duplicate-by-
    // default: a log file is not a decoder worth a dependency, and each mod
    // must log correctly with the others absent. Only the names differ. A
    // fix to one is a lead in the other two (Game Mode Forge has a third).
    //
    // ★ HOW IT WORKS, AND WHY NO LOG LINE IN THE MOD HAD TO CHANGE.
    // `Logger.CreateLogSource(name)` is, in BepInEx 6.0.0-be.785, exactly
    // `new ManualLogSource(name)` plus `Logger.Sources.Add` - and that Add is
    // the ONLY thing that wires a source's LogEvent to the shared listeners
    // (LogOutput.log, the console). `ManualLogSource.Log` does nothing but
    // raise its own event. So a source made here and never added reaches
    // nobody but us: every `Log.LogInfo(...)` in the mod keeps working, and
    // lands in this file instead. Every source in the mod is one
    // `static readonly ManualLogSource Log = ModuleForgeLog.Source("...")` line;
    // logfiletest.py fails if a `CreateLogSource` comes back.
    //
    // His four answers decided the rest:
    //   * Our lines go to THIS FILE ONLY - not the console either.
    //   * ERRORS are also copied to LogOutput.log (and so the console), so
    //     anyone troubleshooting sees at once that a Forge mod broke.
    //   * The launch before is kept as ModuleForge.prev.log. A relaunch (the
    //     Game Mode Forge restart row, or quitting to the desktop for R19 test
    //     259) would otherwise wipe the session you wanted to read.
    //   * The files sit in the BepInEx folder, beside LogOutput.log.
    //
    // ★ AND ONE THING NOBODY ASKED FOR THAT IT FIXES: BepInEx's `WriteUnityLog`
    // defaults to false, which puts "Unity Log" on DiskLogListener's
    // blacklist - so the GAME's own errors, including an exception thrown out
    // of one of our Harmony patches, were in NO file he could send. Not one
    // "Unity Log" line in any saved log. `GameErrorCatcher` copies any game
    // error whose stack trace names a class of this mod into this file.
    //
    // ⚠ Diagnostic code must not throw (it cost five rounds once). Every
    // path here catches, and every failure FALLS BACK TO LogOutput.log AND
    // SAYS SO - a log that silently went nowhere is the worst possible
    // version of this feature.
