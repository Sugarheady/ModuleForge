    // PAYING FOR A MODULE WITH SOMETHING OTHER THAN MONEY.
    //
    // ★★ THE ENTIRE MECHANISM WAS ALREADY THERE, INCLUDING THE UI, and that
    // is the whole reason this feature is small. Everything below is width
    // this mod was declining to use rather than anything new:
    //
    //   * `ShopItemConfig.price` is a **`List<Price>`**, not a number, and a
    //     `Price` is either an `Ingredient` (held in the run's `Vault`) or a
    //     `Resource` (a tank on the ship).
    //   * `Shop` deducts EVERY entry on purchase - `vault.Remove` per
    //     ingredient, a tank subtraction per resource - and `CanAfford`
    //     requires all of them.
    //   * `ShopItemConfig.priceIncrement` is a second list, and
    //     `ShopItem.IncreasePrice` matches each increment to the price of the
    //     SAME currency. So escalation is per-currency for free.
    //   * **`ShopItemWidget` already does `foreach (Price price in
    //     shopItem.price)`** and instantiates one `PriceWidget` each, which
    //     picks `ingredient.iconSmall` or `resource.icon` and reddens the
    //     number when you cannot afford it. **A multi-currency cost renders
    //     correctly with no UI work at all**, which is normally the expensive
    //     half of a feature like this.
    //
    // Both mods were building that object with a hard-coded one-element list
    // of `Resource Money`. This is the part that stops flattening it.
    //
    // Duplicated FROM Weapon Forge's `ForgeShopCost` rather than shared, per
    // the standing rule: each mod must build and run with the other absent.
    // Copy from the fixed twin when either changes - the two are meant to be
    // readable side by side, which is also what makes a drift obvious.
